# Lumikâ€™s C++ style guide

This is my personal C++ style guide. I would be happy to consider your
suggestions for improvements. The style guide can be found in
[style_guide.md][style_guide_file] file. This style guide is inspired by the
[Google style guide][g_style_guide], [C++ Core Guidelines][core_guidelines] and
[LLVM Coding Standards][llvm_coding_standards].
